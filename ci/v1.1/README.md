# Version 1.1 Continuous Integration (CI)&mdash;Assignment 7

This version of the CI test is to be used in Assignment&nbsp;7, working with integration tests.  It includes different versions of files to apply in different branches.  Corresponding files in `s2/v1.1` must also be applied at the same time.

* Files prefixed `a7_*` are for your "own" branch.
* Files prefixed `a7_other_dev_*` are for the "other_dev" branch.

See the assignment description for further details.


We further generated playlist.py to implement serval CRUD related functions in the new feature playlist.

We also implemented a test_playlist.py to test the correctness for the new functions generated in the playlist.py.
